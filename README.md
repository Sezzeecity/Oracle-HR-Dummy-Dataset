### 🔹 Salary Analysis

* Divide employee salary by 2 and display as `half_salary`
* Find employees earning between **10,000 and 17,000**
* Identify employees earning **above average salary**
* Fetch the **highest, second-highest**, and other salary-related records
* Calculate **5-year salary projections**
* Compute **weekly salaries** and apply conditions

### 🔹 Filtering & Exclusions

* Exclude employees by specific names (e.g., Steven, Neena, Lex)
* Filter employees by salary ranges
* Fetch employees hired after specific dates
* Exclude highest-paid employee records

### 🔹 Aggregations & Grouping

* Count employees with the same `first_name`
* Find how many employees were hired on the same date
* Count employees per `job_id`
* Identify job roles with fewer than five employees

### 🔹 String & Pattern Matching

* Employees whose names:

  * Start with a specific letter
  * Contain certain characters
  * End with a specific character
  * Have a fixed number of characters

### 🔹 Advanced Queries

* Fetch top 10 records using `ROWNUM`
* Retrieve first and last records from the table
* Find employees hired in the same month
* Identify employees hired in **August**
* Join multiple tables to generate a **complete employee profile string**

Example output:

> *“Steven King is AD_PRES at Executive in 1297 via Cola di Rie, Argentina, Europe”*
